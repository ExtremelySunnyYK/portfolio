## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I currently work with Chainlink Labs to scale Chainlink services across multiple blockchains, both EVM and non-EVM, by building a universal cross-chain platform and working on the core node. I have close to 5 years of experience in engineering, where 4 years have been deeply rooted in infrastructure, distributed systems, and smart contract development within the blockchain space.

Before my tenure at Chainlink Labs, I have had the privilege of working with some of the most respected companies in the Web3 arena, including:

- Nethermind: Focused on off-chain infrastructure development, optimizing performance and reliability.
- Spartan Labs: Led smart contract development projects, enhancing security and functionality.
- StraitsX: Contributed to the development of financial integrations for stablecoin transactions.
- Treehouse Finance: Innovated on DeFi analytics, working with smart contracts and off-chain data aggregation.

I'm passionate about blockchain, distributed systems, and cybersecurity.
